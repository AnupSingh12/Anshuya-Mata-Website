After reaching Mandal village, pilgrims must trek around 5 km through the forest to reach the revered Ansuya Mata Temple.</p>

To the north lies the Joshimath valley and nine surrounding villages.</p>

The path to the temple includes trails cut through dense forest, requiring physical effort. The trail includes river crossings and steep ascents. A spring flows under a massive stone slab along the path, called the Veetr Kund, from which the place gets the name Veetr Dham. Several myths and stories are associated with this miraculous stream.</p>

When the goddesses Lakshmi, Parvati, and Saraswati became jealous, they urged their husbands (Vishnu, Shiva, and Brahma) to test Ansuya’s chastity. Ansuya, through her divine power, turned them into infants. Pleased with her purity, the Trimurti granted her a boon, and from them was born Lord Dattatreya — a unified incarnation of all three deities.</p>

During this festival, devotees from various regions gather, and the temple premises are beautifully decorated. Women pilgrims stay near the temple, praying to Ansuya Mata. It is believed that by meditating during the night, divine visions are granted. At 4 AM, the temple doors open, and a grand worship is performed. A traditional spiritual discourse is then delivered to the gathering.</p>
